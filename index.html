          the time of second dose and that the first dose was administered more

        <div class="q">1. Why do I need a vaccination certificate?</div>
        <div class="ans">
          A COVID Vaccine Certificate (CVC) issued by the government offers an
          assurance to the beneficiary on the vaccination, type of vaccine used,
          and the provisional certificate also provides the next vaccination
          due. It also is an evidence for the citizen to prove to any entities
          which may require proof of vaccination specially in case of travel.
          Vaccination not only protects individuals from disease, but also
          reduces their risk of spreading the virus. Therefore, there could be a
          requirement in future to produce certificate for certain kind of
          social interactions and international travel. In this context the
          certificate issued by Co-WIN has built in security features to
          guarantee genuineness of the certificate which can be digitally
          verified using approved utilities which are provided in Co-WIN portal.
